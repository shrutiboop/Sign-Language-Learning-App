##PROMPT:
Consider the different ways that these issues might affect populations and the different types of manufactured ecosystems that might be developed to support or replace existing ecosystem services. Pick one of these manufactured ecosystems that would be needed to support or replace existing ecosystem services. Using this manufactured ecosystem, imagine that you need to develop a web or mobile application to support it. For example, the manufactured ecosystem might require a web or mobile application to assist with monitoring it

##BRAINSTORMING:
Ideas:
An artificial zoo almost
A forest where animals live to prevent extension with an app that can teach users about animals and stuff 
An app that will help people sign language
Duolingo but for American Sign Language

Manufactured Ecosystem

##DESCRIBING OUR APP:
Our application is a fun and innovative way for people of all ages to learn some of the many different kinds of sign languages in the world right now. Communicating with a deaf or hard-of-hearing person can be frustrating for both parties when things get confusing. Our app will be able to teach the user their choice of sign language - may that be American, British, French, etc. - and will have daily reminders to continue their streak to help ensure the user really is learning. Our app will also have a social aspect that will encourage users to not only interact with their friends but also have them strive for better scores from games that teach so they can learn and play at the same time.

##WHAT MANUFACTURED ECOSYSTEM DOES IT SUPPORT AND HOW:

	This app supports the Cultural Manufactured Ecosystem because it benefits the quality of life and community. More specifically, it falls under the subsection of Inspiration/Education. This comes from the education portion of the app which helps teach people how to learn sign language. The benefit of the Cultural Ecosystem service we targeted with this idea helps promote knowledge along with health and well-being (Ecosystem Services - nature's benefits 2023). 

##WHAT APPS EXIST, AND HOW OURS IS DIFFERENT:
There are many apps available online for sign language, after doing some research we have found that most apps are either not free of charge(add reference), or just teach one sign language such as ASl or the app doesn’t allow for multiple users to share their progress and interact to create a community or they are only available for ios devices which create a barrier for people with financial difficulty and cannot afford expensive phones. Our app’s goal is to provide as many sign languages as possible, make it free and accessible for everyone while also creating a sense of community.
WHY WOULD A USER WANT TO USE OUR APP (IN CONTEXT OF MANUFACTURED ECOSYSTEM):
The manufactured ecosystem that best fits our application is inspiration and education. This is the ecosystem for literature, art, and other forms of communication. Users will want to use our app because learning a new language is one of the best ways to communicate with others while also improving oneself. With changing times people want to develop relationships by making everyone feel seen. This could include taking efforts to learn a language someone is comfortable communicating with or gestures to show our love.Our app will teach users how to communicate with friends, family, and strangers, to have a more connected community regardless of the barriers.

##IDENTIFY HOW EACH PERSONA WILL USE EACH THING THAT THE USER WOULD LIKE TO DO WITH THE APP:
Our primary users are regular users who would like to learn sign language, improve their proficiency or learn a completely new language.The primary persona would essentially login to the app whenever they are free or when they are scheduled to learn and spend around 15 minutes average everyday to educate themselves, after which they might collect points according to their level of completion and use it change their avatars or they could spend time supporting their friends and family learning in the app by taking shared quizzes and sharing each other’s progress.

Secondary Users use the app less frequently 1-2x a week and spend an average of 5-10 minutes, they are learning sign language as a hobby or to communicate more efficiently with their closed ones.They are less likely to focus on getting points and change avatars but they might be more interested in recommending their friends to also join them.



The manufactured ecosystem chosen: Cultural Manufactured ecosystem.

The app falls under Cultural Manufactured ecosystem and under the Inspiration/Education subsection. Our existing applications for sign language learning involves traditional methods such as classes, online tutorials and book modules, these methods are still valuable but they can be  limiting in terms of engagement and personalization. Our application will support the manufactured ecosystem education/Inspiration by providing a gamified version for users to learn sign languages in a fun and interactive way. 
There also has been research showing the beneficial effects of gamification on the teaching and learning of new languages(Smith, K. (2018)). It has been demonstrated to enhance students' interaction with the material and boost their proficiency. Considering the inherent challenges in learning a new language, gamification emerges as a valuable strategy to enhance learner motivation.(Smith, K. (2018)).
Another study was conducted by researchers who collaborated with teachers and students from SK Pendidikan Khas Melaka.This study explores challenges faced by children with hearing disabilities, such as a lack of exposure to correct sign language and difficulties in focusing during learning(i-sign,2019). To address these issues, the study developed i-Sign, a learning application incorporating gamification, which was well-received in usability tests, showing promise as a tool to improve learning outcomes and promote sign language awareness.(i-sign,2019).


###Similar Applications, and how ours is different:
-Ours is not the first app that teaches users sign language, however, ours adds many innovative elements to further enhance user experience. Most other apps for learning sign language are expensive, and that provides a barrier for people trying to learn. Also, most apps do not have a community aspect that allows users to encourage their friends and family to keep up with lessons, and not many apps for learning sign language include elements of fun to encourage users to keep learning. Ours will provide in-app collectibles as rewards for completing lessons, that can be used to customize the user’s character, and shown off to friends on the app, which will provide competition and a feeling of being rewarded, which will provide more motivation to the user to use the app. Our app will also be free, with the option of purchasing more “reward boxes,” with the funds going towards supporting the app. Users will be able to get the full experience of the app and learn just as well, for free.
-Describe anything else your application might need
-Videos and picture resources from various sign language experts
-This would feature all the types of sign languages that exist out there
-Access to the front camera to allow for the user to see themselves practice
-Access to contacts to suggest people to add their friends and family

###Identify use cases for the application:
View and complete a lesson in the Lesson/Home screen
Opening a gift box after the lesson is done which you get a reward
Add a family member/friend as a connection and view that connection in the Connections screen
Customize your character in the Profile screen
View and navigate to a specific unit in the Units Map screen
Evaluate your application with people outside the class, and discuss how this changed the app:
Font in language selection is hard to read, have adjustable font size before that option
Add a dark mode option
Add a caption under the button to add a friend that says “add”
Add text stating you’re adding a connection at the top of adding connection screen
The button for adding a photo looks more like adding a profile photo than adding a contact, change instead to have a plus button next to family or friends heading
X button after character customization doesn’t indicate saving changes
Font on unit map screen is very small and difficult to read
Notes were taken during a session of user testing

##How the personas were considered:
	The primary persona, Sarah, was considered in the design of the wireframe in the following ways:
-Sound effects are not the only method of providing feedback that the application uses, all feedback will be provided visually as well. Audio will be silent by default
-Both dark and light modes will be offered, as only light mode may be too bright to use later at night, when she may use the app
-She will be able to add and encourage her friends and family on the app
-The app will allow users to start out at a higher level of fluency, instead of being required to start at the beginning
-Blue will be used as the app’s main colour
-Contacting the developers about bugs or feedback will be offered fully through text


	##The secondary persona, Charlie, was considered in the design of the wireframe in the following ways:
-Lessons will be able to be downloaded in case of future unreliable internet
-Dark mode will be offered, in order to ease visibility at night when she may be using the app
-Motivation will be provided through rewards through the app in order to help her keep up with her studies
-She will be able to decide her goals from the beginning in order to learn vocabulary most relevant to her needs first
-Sound effects will be available to be turned on so that she can receive auditory feedback from the app, as well as visual

###Approaches to accessibility in the video:
Closed captions were added to the video
The video contains alternative text, with timestamps, for all visuals
Initial Video Script:

Hello! And Welcome to ‘What?’! ‘What?’ is an application dedicated to teaching its users sign languages used across the world. 

Our app is based on the Cultural Manufactured Ecosystem in the subsection of Inspiration/Education. 

Traditional approaches including courses, online tutorials, and book modules are used in our current sign language learning systems.
While they are still valuable, they can be limited in terms of engagement and personalization.
Our software will help users learn sign languages in an engaging and participatory way by offering a gamified version that will complement the manufactured ecosystem of Education/Inspiration. 


###USE CASE 1:
For our first use case, we have the user open their first lesson. They go through the basic phrases taught in lesson 1, and complete the lesson. Following that, as a reward, they are gifted their first gift box to incentivise their learning habits. 

###USE CASE 2: 
The user, after completing their first lesson, would like their friends and family to see their progress as well as see how their friends and family are competing. The user opens up the connections page and sends out some friend requests.

###USE CASE 3: 
During the third use case, our user would like to edit their avatar to make sure they stand out amongst their friends and family. The user customizes their avatar.

###USE CASE 4:
The user is curious what they will learn in the future, so they explore the upcoming units and search for a specific one in the Unit Map Screen.

For the use of ‘What?’, there is a primary and a secondary persona.

###The primary persona, Sarah, was developed through the wireframe in the following ways: 
-The application employs more than just sound effects to deliver feedback; every feedback will also be displayed visually. By default, the audio will be mute.
-There will be both dark and light settings available since later at night, when she would use the app, the light mode might be too bright to use.
-On the app, she will be able to add and support her friends and family.
-Instead of having to start from scratch, the software would let users begin at a greater level of fluency.
-The primary hue of the app will be blue.
-All forms of communication with the developers regarding issues or feedback will be provided via text

###The secondary persona, Charlie, was also developed through the wireframe in the following ways:
-In the event that the internet becomes unreliable in the future, lessons can be downloaded.
-To make it easier for her to see at night when she might be using the app, a dark mode will be available.
-Rewards from the app will serve as motivation to help her stay on top of her schoolwork.
-She will have the freedom to choose her objectives right away so that she can start learning the words that will be most useful to her.
-She will be able to enable sound effects so that the app may provide her with both visual and audio feedback.

Thank you for your time
