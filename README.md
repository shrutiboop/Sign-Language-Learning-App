# Sign-Language-Learning-App
  
Prototype for Sign Language Learning Application


Understanding the Problem

Designing the user interface (UI) for my sign language learning app was a comprehensive process that focused on meeting the diverse needs of potential users. I began by conducting in-depth research to understand the specific requirements of individuals at various skill levels, ranging from beginners to advanced learners. This research was instrumental in creating detailed user personas, which served as the foundation for my design decisions.



Research and Discovery

Using the insights gathered from my research, I proceeded to create wireframes and prototypes to visualize the app's layout and functionality. One of my primary goals was to ensure that the app was easy to navigate, catering to both hearing and deaf users. To achieve this, I carefully designed the app's navigation structure, ensuring that it was intuitive and user-friendly. Additionally, I paid close attention to the visual design of the app, opting for high contrast colors and clear icons to enhance usability.



Design and Prototyping

The visual design was not only crucial for usability but also for accessibility. I wanted to ensure that the app was accessible to all users, including those with visual impairments. As such, I incorporated features such as large, easy-to-read text and clear visual cues to aid comprehension. Overall, the UI design process for my sign language learning app was a meticulous and iterative one, driven by a strong focus on user needs and accessibility. Next, I created wireframes and prototypes to visualize the app's layout and functionality. I focused on making the app easy to navigate, especially for both hearing and deaf users. I also paid attention to the visual design, using high contrast colors and icons to enhance usability.


User testing was crucial for gathering feedback and making improvements. Through this process, I was able to refine the UI to meet the needs of my users.



Final Product

Overall, designing the UI for my sign language learning app has been a rewarding experience. I'm proud of the user-friendly design I've created and excited to see how it helps people learn sign language.Here is a user case I developed using figma to create a prototype. This user case is used to describe the flow path of a user navigating to see their map screen in the app.
